# Event Timer

Event Timer is an app for managing events. An event consists of a time and an optional note. The time is the time the event was recorded. A session consists of zero or more events. A session also has a create time, a start time (the time of the first event), a stop time (the time of the last event), and a name. From these the duration, which is the time from the previous event to this event is also available. A session could correspond, for example, to lap times as measured by a stopwatch, or the times you woke up while sleeping. Event Timer was originally designed for the latter purpose.
